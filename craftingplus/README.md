### Spells
Spells are a new kind of enchantment. 
A spell can be added to or removed from an item at the Advanced Magic Table.
A single item can only have **one** spell applied to it

### Crafting an Advanced Magic Table ingame
1. Place a dropper facing up anywhere
2. Throw Redstone Block ontop of it

4. Finished

### Crafting/Enchanting
The top middle slot of the advancved magic table is where you put lapis lazuli. Each Spell-Recipe takes a specific number of lapi lazuli to apply a spell.
The middle slot is the slot where the actual item, the spell should be applied to, comes.
The other slots are for the items required by the spell-recipe and can be anything.
After putting in the recipe, just right click the floating enchanting table above the dropper.
